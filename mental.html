            <h3>we care about you.</h3>
            <p>In this unprecedented time, it has become more important than ever to take care
                of our mental health. A pandemic can be an extremely stressful period for individuals
                across the world. It is normal to feel stress and anxiety during these times, however, Covi-track 
                believes that there are plenty of healthy and effective methods to cope with these
                perceived threats.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>To combat waves of depression and anxiety, Covi-track has developed an app, through
                which it allows users to join live video calls with others in our global community,
                walkthrough a live art gallery, and communicate with peers. Covi-track's new app allows you 
                to pause, breathe, reflect, and connect with others to restore our disheveled balance in life.
            </p>
            <h4>Download the Figma app today to start your restoration.</h4>
